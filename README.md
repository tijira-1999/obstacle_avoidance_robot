# obstacle_avoidance_robot

A three headed tyrant that can avoid obstacles and throw playful tantrums


First Install the Arduino Library
    Before you can use the Motor shield, you must install the AF_Motor Arduino library - this will instruct the Arduino how to talk to the Adafruit Motor shield, and it isn't optional!
    
    First, grab the library from github or the compressed file
    
    Uncompress the ZIP file onto your desktop
    
    Rename the uncompressed folder AFMotor
    
    Check that inside AFMotor is AFMotor.cpp and AFMotor.h files. If not, check the steps above
    
    Place the AFMotor folder into your arduinosketchfolder/libraries folder. For Windows, this will probably be something like MY Documents/Arduino/libraries for Mac it will be something likeDocuments/arduino/libraries. If this is the first time you are installing a library, you'll need to create the libraries folder. Make sure to call it libraries exactly, no caps, no other name.
    
    Check that inside the libraries folder there is the AFMotor folder, and inside AFMotor isAFMotor.cpp AFMotor.h and some other files
    
    Quit and restart the IDE. You should now have a submenu called File->Examples->AFMotor->MotorParty
